To compile:
g++ ECGraphicViewImp.cpp test-gv.cpp Command.cpp ShapesModel.cpp Shape.cpp ECRealObserver.cpp MouseFunction.cpp -lallegro -lallegro_font -lallegro_primitives -lallegro_main -lallegro_image -lallegro_main -o editor

To run:

Features Implemented:
Edit Mode:
- opens by default
- allows user to select shapes that have been drawn
- clicking inside a shape makes it selected
- if there are multiple shapes in the same area, then the most recently placed shape gets selected
- once a shape is selected, it can be moved across the screen
- when a user keeps their mouse held down after selecting a shape, they can move the shape; the original shape maintains its place, but a new cyan shape is shown moving with the user's cursor; once the cursor is released, the original selected shape is moved to match the new position.

Switching modes:
- user can press space to toggle between modes

Insert Mode:
- when clicking the mouse and holding down, when user moves cursor, a pink shape is shown on screen that adjusts size with the user's mouse
- when releasing the mouse, the shape is placed with opposite corners at the original mouse down event location and the mouse up event location

Deleting:
- user can delete shapes with the "D" key

Undo/Redo:
- user can undo/redo any command (insert, delete, move) with "Z"/"Y" keys respectively

This design uses MVC, Command Pattern, and Observer Pattern.
